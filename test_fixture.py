"""Adversarial fixture for: bfmr-orphan-link-creator

>>> THE ONE THING THE GENERATOR CANNOT WRITE FOR YOU <<<

CASES is empty and the verify FAILS until you fill it in. That is deliberate.
A generator can emit a verify that DISCRIMINATES (fails at baseline, passes on
a fix). It cannot decide whether the verify is RELEVANT -- whether it tests the
property the task actually asked for. A benign case passes broken work.

Pick inputs that separate "did the job" from "made the test go green":
  * the exact boundary the defect is about, and one on each side of it
  * the degenerate inputs (missing key, None, empty, wrong type) that must NOT
    raise
  * at least one case that a plausible WRONG fix would fail
  * the regression half: things that already work and must keep working

Each case: (description, callable_returning_actual, expected)
